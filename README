1.  compiler.cc     compiler.h

contains the code that will interpret the intermediate representation (data structure) that your program will generate. YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY THIS FILE. When you submit your code, we will provide our copy of compiler.cc to make sure that you did not modify it.

2.  demo.cc

This is an important file that contains a sample data structure for a sample input program. You should definitely, try to draw the data structure by hand.

3.  ir_debug.cc    ir_debug.h

contains code that allows you to print your data structure. ir_debug makes some assumption about how your data structure is linked that is not required by the intermediate representation. If you are getting set faults when you use ir_debug, you should read the code of ir_debug to understand its requirements. This can be a useful tool.
